## üéÆ How to Play

1.  **Objective:** The goal is to complete more boxes than your opponent.
2.  **Turns:** Players take turns connecting two adjacent dots with a horizontal or vertical line.
3.  **Controls:**
    *   **Click** on a cell area to select it.
    *   Use the **Arrow Keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) to attempt to draw a line on the corresponding side of the selected cell.
4.  **Claiming Boxes:** If drawing a line completes the fourth side of a box, the player claims that box (marked with their symbol/color) and gets another turn.
5.  **Winning:** The game ends when all dots are connected. The player who claimed more boxes wins.
6.  **Game Options:**
    *   Press `R` to restart the game at any time.
    *   Press `Q` or `Esc` to quit.
